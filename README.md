# Description and Credits

Description: This plugin is designed to have NPC overhead dialogue be displayed in your game chat (for those with poor eyesight). It also includes a whitelist that filters out all the chat messages by default. Use the same format as the NPC Indicators to do so 

Example:
(NPC Name), (NPC Name), (NPC Name)
